# JavaScript from scratch

This repo is an attempt to rewrite basic, well known JavaScript functions from scratch, using JavaScript.

The goal is not to be succint or create performant implementations, but rather to be clear and explicit, in order to show what the algorithm under the hood may look like.

_Note: These implementations do not entirely follow the [ecma-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/) specification (when it applies): although I try as much as possible to adhere to it, the purpose of this repo is to create simple implementations that can help understanding the general behaviour of the language, not necessarily cover all edge cases._
